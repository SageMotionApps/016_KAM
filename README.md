# 016 Knee Adduction Moment (KAM)
Estimation of Knee Adduction Moment (KAM) from wearable IMUs during walking. 

### Nodes Required: 7 
 - Sensing (7): 
   - left foot (top of the foot, with switch pointing towards body)
   - right foot (top of the foot, with switch pointing towards body)
   - left shank (Midway between Femur Lateral Epicondyle and Fibula Apex of Lateral Malleolus)
   - right shank (Midway between Femur Lateral Epicondyle and Fibula Apex of Lateral Malleolus)
   - left thigh ( Midway between Femur Greater Trochanter and Femur Lateral Epicondyle)
   - right thigh ( Midway between Femur Greater Trochanter and Femur Lateral Epicondyle)
   - pelvis (Midway between Left and Right Anterior Superior Iliac Spine)
 - Feedback (0)


## Algorithm & Calibration
### Calibration Process:
No initial static calibration is performed to compensate for misalignment with the segment, so the user should be standing upright when starting the trial.

## ML Model Statistics 
Our KAM app has two modes, real-time and offline. Due to limited computational resources, the sage system cannot run the full-size model in real-time. Thus, the real-time model has a reduced size and lower performance. 

- Real-time model with size reduction: RMSE = 0.9 (%Body weight * Body height), r = 0.79
- Offline full-size model: RMSE= 0.6 (%Body weight * Body height), r = 0.87,

RMSE is the root mean square error, and r is the correlation coefficient.
